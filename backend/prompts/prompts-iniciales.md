# ATS Backend. Cursor

## Prompt 1

you are a developer node js expert. This is the current project @backend  is working on node.js and usign prisma as ORM. I want you to create new endpoints for a ATS  (Applicant Tracking System) using the next best practices: DDD, SOLID principles and DRY. Bellow is the description of the first endpoint: 

---
**Endpoint:** `GET /positions/:id/candidates`

This endpoint retrieves all candidates currently in process for a specific position, meaning all applications associated with a given `positionID`. The response should provide the following basic information:

- **Candidate's Full Name**: Retrieved from the `candidate` table.
- **Current Interview Step**: Indicates the current stage of the interview process for the candidate, retrieved from the `application` table.
- **Average Candidate Score**: The average score from all interviews (each interview conducted with the candidate has a score).

---

Before start ask me all the questions you need. Do not write code yet

## Answer 1 - AI

Thank you for providing the details of the new endpoint you want to create for the Applicant Tracking System. Before I start writing the code, I have a few questions to ensure I understand the requirements and the current project structure correctly:

1. Is there an existing controller for handling position-related endpoints? If not, should we create a new one?

2. Are there any existing services or repositories that handle position or candidate data retrieval?

3. How is error handling currently implemented in the project? Is there a standardized approach?

4. Are there any specific authentication or authorization requirements for this endpoint?

5. Is pagination required for the candidate list, or should all candidates be returned at once?

6. How should the average candidate score be calculated if a candidate has no interviews yet?

7. Are there any specific performance considerations we need to keep in mind, especially if a position has a large number of candidates?

8. Is there a preferred format for the API response (e.g., specific field names, nested objects)?

9. Are there any additional filters or sorting options that should be included in this endpoint?

10. Should we include any additional information about the position itself in the response?

Once I have answers to these questions, I'll be better equipped to design and implement the endpoint following the best practices you mentioned (DDD, SOLID principles, and DRY).

## Prompt 2

1. No, there is not, create a new one
2. no, create te services or repositories
3. See the   to managa the error of the controllers, and see @candidateService.ts  for the services
4. No, there is not any specific authentication
5. No pagination required
6. Do not include candidates without any interview 
7.  No it is not any specification for this
8. No, there is not a specific format, return the object of the model
9. No
10. No

## Answer 2 - AI

Thank you for providing the additional information. I'll create a new endpoint for retrieving candidates for a specific position based on your requirements. I'll implement this using DDD, SOLID principles, and DRY.

Let's start by creating a new service for handling position-related operations:

```typescript:backend/src/application/services/positionService.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import { Position } from '../../domain/models/Position';
import { Application } from '../../domain/models/Application';
import { Candidate } from '../../domain/models/Candidate';
import { Interview } from '../../domain/models/Interview';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export const getCandidatesForPosition = async (positionId: number) => {
  const position = await Position.findOne(positionId);
  if (!position) {
    throw new Error('Position not found');
  }

  const applications = await prisma.application.findMany({
    where: { positionId },
    include: {
      candidate: true,
      interviews: {
        include: {
          interviewStep: true,
        },
      },
    },
  });

  return applications.map((application) => {
    const averageScore = calculateAverageScore(application.interviews);
    return {
      fullName: `${application.candidate.firstName} ${application.candidate.lastName}`,
      currentInterviewStep: application.interviewStep.name,
      averageScore: averageScore,
    };
  });
};

const calculateAverageScore = (interviews: Interview[]): number | null => {
  const scores = interviews.map((interview) => interview.score).filter((score): score is number => score !== null);
  if (scores.length === 0) return null;
  return scores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0) / scores.length;
};
```

Now, let's create a new controller for position-related endpoints:

```typescript:backend/src/presentation/controllers/positionController.ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { getCandidatesForPosition } from '../../application/services/positionService';

export const getCandidatesForPositionController = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const positionId = parseInt(req.params.id);
    if (isNaN(positionId)) {
      return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid position ID' });
    }

    const candidates = await getCandidatesForPosition(positionId);
    res.json(candidates);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error) {
      res.status(404).json({ error: error.message });
    } else {
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'An unexpected error occurred' });
    }
  }
};
```

Finally, let's add a new route for this endpoint:

```typescript:backend/src/routes/positionRoutes.ts
import { Router } from 'express';
import { getCandidatesForPositionController } from '../presentation/controllers/positionController';

const router = Router();

router.get('/:id/candidates', getCandidatesForPositionController);

export default router;
```

Now, we need to update the main `index.ts` file to include this new route:


```39:40:backend/src/index.ts
// Import and use candidateRoutes
app.use('/candidates', candidateRoutes);
```


Add the following line after the existing routes:

```typescript
app.use('/positions', positionRoutes);
```

This implementation follows DDD by separating the domain logic (in the Position and Application models), application logic (in the positionService), and presentation logic (in the positionController). It adheres to SOLID principles by having single responsibilities for each function and class, and it's open for extension. The DRY principle is followed by reusing existing models and avoiding code duplication.

To use this new endpoint, you would make a GET request to `/positions/:id/candidates`, where `:id` is the ID of the position you're interested in. The response will include the full name of each candidate, their current interview step, and their average score (if they have any interviews).


## Prompt 3

is @getCandidatesForPosition  comply with SOLID principles?

## Answer 3 - AI

The current implementation of `getCandidatesForPosition` doesn't fully comply with SOLID principles. Let's analyze it and suggest improvements:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The function is doing multiple things - fetching applications, mapping data, and calculating average scores. We should separate these concerns.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The function is not easily extensible without modification.

3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The function directly depends on the Prisma client and the Position model, which are high-level modules.

To improve this, we can:

1. Separate the data fetching logic into a repository layer.
2. Create a separate mapper for transforming application data.
3. Move the average score calculation to a utility function.
4. Use dependency injection for the repository.

Here's a refactored version that better adheres to SOLID principles:

```typescript
import { IApplicationRepository } from '../../domain/repositories/IApplicationRepository';
import { ApplicationMapper } from '../../domain/mappers/ApplicationMapper';
import { PositionNotFoundError } from '../../domain/errors/PositionNotFoundError';
import { CandidateDTO } from '../../domain/dto/CandidateDTO';

export class GetCandidatesForPositionUseCase {
  constructor(private applicationRepository: IApplicationRepository) {}

  async execute(positionId: number): Promise<CandidateDTO[]> {
    const applications = await this.applicationRepository.findByPositionId(positionId);

    if (applications.length === 0) {
      throw new PositionNotFoundError(positionId);
    }

    return applications.map(ApplicationMapper.toCandidateDTO);
  }
}
```

This refactored version:

1. Uses a repository interface, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.
2. Separates the mapping logic into a dedicated mapper class.
3. Throws a custom error for better error handling.
4. Returns a DTO (Data Transfer Object) instead of an ad-hoc object.

You would need to create the following additional files:

1. IApplicationRepository interface
2. ApplicationMapper class
3. PositionNotFoundError class
4. CandidateDTO interface

This structure allows for easier testing, extension, and maintenance, better adhering to SOLID principles.

## Prompt 4

give me all the code to do this changes to comply with SOLID principles

## Answer 4 - AI

.... All the code

## Prompt 5

what new files and folders should I create for the code created?

## Answer 5 - AI

Based on the code we've created and the existing structure, we should create the following new files and folders:

1. Create a new folder:
   `backend/src/domain/repositories`

2. Create a new file:
   `backend/src/domain/repositories/IApplicationRepository.ts`

3. Create a new folder:
   `backend/src/domain/mappers`

4. Create a new file:
   `backend/src/domain/mappers/ApplicationMapper.ts`

5. Create a new folder:
   `backend/src/domain/errors`

6. Create a new file:
   `backend/src/domain/errors/PositionNotFoundError.ts`

7. Create a new folder:
   `backend/src/domain/dto`

8. Create a new file:
   `backend/src/domain/dto/CandidateDTO.ts`

9. Create a new folder:
   `backend/src/infrastructure/repositories`

10. Create a new file:
    `backend/src/infrastructure/repositories/ApplicationRepository.ts`

These new files and folders will help organize the code according to the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and SOLID principles we've implemented.


## Prompt 6

I am getting this error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'calculateAverageScore')"

## Answer 6 - AI

The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'calculateAverageScore')" is occurring because you're trying to call `this.calculateAverageScore` in a static method. In static methods, `this` doesn't refer to the class instance, so you can't access other static methods using `this`.

To fix this, you should call the static method directly using the class name. Let's modify the `ApplicationMapper` class:


```4:21:backend/src/domain/mappers/ApplicationMapper.ts
export class ApplicationMapper {
  static toCandidateDTO(application: Application): CandidateDTO {
    const averageScore = this.calculateAverageScore(application.interviews);
    return {
      fullName: `${application.candidate.firstName} ${application.candidate.lastName}`,
      currentInterviewStep: application.interviewStep.name,
      averageScore: averageScore,
    };
  }

  private static calculateAverageScore(interviews: any[]): number | null {
    const scores = interviews
      .map((interview) => interview.score)
      .filter((score): score is number => score !== null);
    if (scores.length === 0) return null;
    return scores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0) / scores.length;
  }
}
```


Replace the content of this file with the following:

```typescript
export class ApplicationMapper {
  static toCandidateDTO(application: Application): CandidateDTO {
    const averageScore = ApplicationMapper.calculateAverageScore(application.interviews);
    return {
      fullName: `${application.candidate.firstName} ${application.candidate.lastName}`,
      currentInterviewStep: application.interviewStep.name,
      averageScore: averageScore,
    };
  }

  private static calculateAverageScore(interviews: any[]): number | null {
    const scores = interviews
      .map((interview) => interview.score)
      .filter((score): score is number => score !== null);
    if (scores.length === 0) return null;
    return scores.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0) / scores.length;
  }
}
```

The key change is in line 6, where we've replaced `this.calculateAverageScore` with `ApplicationMapper.calculateAverageScore`. This ensures that we're calling the static method correctly.

This change should resolve the error you're encountering.

## Prompt 7

Let's create the next end point. Here are the specifications:

---

**Endpoint:** `PUT /candidates/:id/stage`

This endpoint will update the stage of a candidate (currentInterviewStep of the table Application). It allows modifying the current interview process stage for a specific candidate.

---

Take in account there are already some files for the candidate like @Candidate.ts @candidateService.ts @candidateRoutes.ts , do not modify the existing code for the other endpoints, but for the new endpoint use the same structure and best practices we did for Use the same structure we build for the endpoint create before `GET /positions/:id/candidates` @positionController.ts
